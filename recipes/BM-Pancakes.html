        <div class="title"><h1>Description</h1></div>
            <p>As convenient as a store-bought mix can be, every home cook needs a good buttermilk pancake recipe in their repertoire. Don't have a tried-and-true favorite yet? You're in luck! <strong><em>The Allrecipes community</em></strong> can't get enough of these classic buttermilk pancakes. Reviewers say they're <strong><em>light, fluffy, moist, and full of rich flavor</em></strong>.</p>
        <div class="title"><h1>Ingredients</h1></div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</li>
                <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Just <strong><em>three tablespoons</em></strong> of white sugar should be enough to lend subtle sweetness. Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!</li>
                <li><strong>Leaveners</strong>: Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).</li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong>: You definitely don't want to skip adding a <strong><em>small amount</em></strong> of salt â€” the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong>: Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for <strong><em>three whole cups</em></strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Milk</strong>: Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.</li>
                <li><strong>Eggs</strong>:<strong><em>Three whole eggs</em></strong> add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk pancakes.</li>
                <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist.</li>
            </ul>
        <div class="title"><h1>How to Make ButterMilk Pancakes</h1></div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mix the dry Ingredients</strong>: Combine <strong><em>flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt</em></strong> in a large bowl.</li>
                <li><strong>Mix the wet Ingredients</strong>: Beat the <strong><em>buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter</em></strong> together in a separate bowl. <strong><em>Do not combine</em></strong> the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the pancakes</strong>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook <strong><em>until both sides are brown</em></strong>.</li>
            </ol>
